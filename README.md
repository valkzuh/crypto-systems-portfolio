# crypto-systems-portfolio

This is a full portfolio of all my crypto systems I have created in the past few years.

My old portfolio is incredibly messy and filled with tons of junk, so this is a new and updated one with only my best work.

I have left descriptions on every project inside the README if you just want a quick explanation without diving into all the deep details.

Thank you for allowing me to show off all my years of work.
