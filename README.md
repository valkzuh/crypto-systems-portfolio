# crypto-systems-portfolio

This is a full portfolio of all my crypto systems I have created in the past few years.

My old portfolio is incredibly messy and filled with tons of junk, so this is a new and updated one with only my best work.

I have left descriptions on every project inside the README if you just want a quick explanation without diving into all the deep details.

Thank you for allowing me to show off all my years of work.


About Me:

I am a systems and software engineer with roughly 10 years of experience programming, starting when I was 10 years old with basic robotics. 
I am extensively knowledgable in Java, Python, JavaScript, and C/C++. I have a couple of years of experience with Rust and HTML, and am growing a solid foundation of Solidity as well. 
I have created many projects throughout my years, a good number of physical projects that integrated software and some purely software-based projects. However, each project was almost always something I did out of passion and the desire to learn. 
I am thankful you are allowing me an opportunity to bring in all of my critical thinking, problem-solving, and engineering experience into something I would actually enjoy as work.

I am confident in my knowledge and hope you can see that from these projects.
